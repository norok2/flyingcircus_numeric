Some of the functions within this library depends on:

- numpy
- scipy

These are collected in the into separate submodules:
 - `numpy`: for code depending on `numpy` only.
 - `scipy`: for code depending on both `numpy` and `scipy`.

It is being developed (and hence best tested) with Python 3.6.
While not explicitly tested for, other recent versions of Python 3 are very
likely to be working correctly.

Python 2 is not explicitly supported and although many parts of the library
still work without issues, there may be features not available in Python 2.

If you experience any issues, please consider reporting it.
